    <div class="center">
      <h1 style="padding-left: 20px;">Your Cognitive Profile</h1>

      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Openness</b><br>
        Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete. They tend to avoid the unknown and follow traditional ways. <br> &emsp;&emsp;Openness is strongly related to a person’s interest in art and culture. People who are high in openness tend to enjoy the arts and seek out unusual, complex forms of self-expression. People who are low in openness are often suspicious of the arts and prefer to focus on more practical pursuits.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div id="open" class="skills open"></div>
      </div>
    
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Conscientiousness</b><br>
        Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;The concept of Conscientiousness focuses on a dilemma we all face: shall I do what feels good now, or instead do what is less fun but will pay off in the future? Some people are more likely to choose fun in the moment, and thus are low in Conscientiousness. Others are more likely to work doggedly toward their goals, and thus are high in this trait.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div id="cons" class="skills conscience"></div>
      </div>
    
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Extraversion</b><br>
        Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.<br>

        &emsp;&emsp;Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a “high” from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div id="extra" class="skills extra"></div>
      </div>

      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Agreeableness</b><br>
        greeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.<br>

        &emsp;&emsp;People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <div id="agree" class="skills agree"></div>
      </div>
    
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Neuroticism</b><br>
        Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.<br>

        &emsp;&emsp;This trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.</p>

      </div>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>N-Back</b><br>
        The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity.<br>
      <div class="container">
        <div id="nback" class="skills nback"></div>
      </div>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Simon Task Score</b><br>
        The Simon task and the Simon effect are named after J. R. Simon. Together with his colleague, he first described this effect in 1963. In essence, it shows that people respond faster and more accurately if there is a match between stimulus and response features (e.g., location, when for example stimulus and response are both located on the left side of one’s body).<br>
         &emsp;&emsp;The effect is also known as a stimulus-response compatibility effect. There are many variants of the stimulus-response compatibility available. Like the Stroop effect, it is easy to notice consciously how difficult a mismatch between a stimulus and response can be.

        </div>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Non Verbal Score</b><br>
        Non-Verbal Aptitude, also called non-verbal reasoning, involves the ability to understand and analyze information presented visually and solve problems logically.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Non-verbal aptitude tests are used extensively in selection and assessment processes. The tests include no text and can therefore be considered as less biased than text-based questions, as language and cultural differences are no factor.
